title: "Tools for Data Science"
---
    
Hello! If you stumbled accidentally into my website, welcome. If you are here
because of your own accord, welcome.

In here, you will find some tools in data science that may be useful to you. 
I decided to create a repository of some of the tools I've learned in data science.
In the Fall of 2021, I got accepted at UT Austin's Data Science program. In early 
March 2022, I decided to write this website to document the things I've learned so 
far. 

I hope you learn something from your visit. Enjoy!

### What tools I've used to publish this site?

I use R Markdown and GitHub pages to create this site. I'm still learning the tools; 
although, I have used R and R markdown for a few years now, I have never used GitHub
in publishing my notes.
